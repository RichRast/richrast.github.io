      tldr: "This work introduces a novel deep learning architecture to infer fine grain local ancestry along the genome with simple to use geographical coordinates.
      Additionally, we identify detecting changepoints (when local ancestry changes along the genome) as a key technical problem. To this end, our method detects these changepoints when the prediction uncertainty is high and abstains from making erroneous predictions in the corresponding segments."
