      title: "Ge3Net: Inferring Continuous Population Structure Coordinates Along the Genome"
      authors: <b> Richa Rastogi </b>, Arvind S. Kumar, Helgi Hilmarsson, Carlos D. Bustamante, Daniel Mas Montserrat, Alexander G. Ioannidis
      abstract: "This work targets the disparities in genomic medicine that are emerging between various worldwide populations.
      We propose a deep learning architecture to infer local ancestry along the genome with simple to use coordinates.
      This could extend the benefits of such research and models to more diverse cohorts."
